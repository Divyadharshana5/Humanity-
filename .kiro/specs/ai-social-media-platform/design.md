## Overview

The AI-Powered Social Media Platform is a full-stack web application built with a modern tech stack that provides seamless integration with major social media platforms, intelligent content generation, and automated publishing capabilities. The system follows a microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns between authentication, content generation, scheduling, and publishing services.
